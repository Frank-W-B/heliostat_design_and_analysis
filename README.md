# heliostat_design_and_analysis

This respository contains samples of my work designing and analyzing heliostats for Abengoa.  Though much of the work is confidential, the samples provided were presented to DOE under contract and are in the public domain.

Ten years ago the prices of photovoltaics and batteries were so high that it seemed that concentrating solar thermal was the right choice for cost effective utility-scale solar energy electricity.  However, with large scale silicon refining facilities coming on-line and PV manufacturing subsidies in China, the prices of PV have plummeted and they have taken much of the market.  The prices of batteries are poised to do the same.  Though I feel that concentrating solar thermal will always have a portion of the market, I expect PV and batteries to dominate in the future.
